# Music-detection
Progress status for "Music Detection" project is as follows:

1) We have completed the detailed literature study of the project and finiliased methodology to implement.
2) We have made a PPT of our entire implementation and shared with mentor. 
3) Mentor has replied to it with few comments on frame length considerations, we have changed the duration of frame length and working on implementation
4) We are facing some dependencies issue on PyaudioAnaysis library in python, hopefully this will be solved with in a day or two
5) Overall we are extracting features from the audio files now, once this is done we can TRAIN the classifier accordingly.
